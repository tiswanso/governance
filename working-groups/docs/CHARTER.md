# AGNTCY Documentation Working Group Charter

## Mission

To contribute to and set standards for writing, reviewing, organizing, maintaining, and publishing the AGNTCY collective's
documentation.

## Goals

Create a first-class documentation experience for AGNTCY users by:

- Establishing a documentation strategy and aligning new contributions with it
- Defining style guidelines and terminology for the doc set
- Coordinating the efforts of documentation contributors and encouraging new contributions
- Adopting appropriate tooling to help with automation
- Creating processes that:
  - Lower the time to address PRs and issues
  - Protect the quality of the documentation, especially over time
- Contributing to overall product direction through our experience as the earliest Knative users

## Scope

This group will primarily concern itself with the content of the [docs](https://github.com/agntcy/docs) and [website](https://github.com/agntcy/agntcy-website) repos.
